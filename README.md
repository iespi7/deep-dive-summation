# Summation

## Purpose

This project is a multi-day effort to build a [*Reverse Polish Notation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) (RPN) calculator that takes input from the command line. So far, only the initial steps have been accomplished.

This will eventually support the following post-fix operators:

* Addition 
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division
* Exponentiation
* Modular division

Development will follow these steps:

1. Read input from command line (complete).
2. Distinguish operands and operators (complete).
3. Implement stack interpreter (partially complete).
